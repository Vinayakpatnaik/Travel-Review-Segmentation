# Travel-Review-Segmentation
To cluster reviews on google rating data, using a hierarchical clustering algorithm .

### Abstract: 
Understanding the tastes of each user and the characteristics of each 
product is necessary to predict how a user will respond to a new product. 
This latent user and product dimensions can be discovered with the help of 
user feedback. A numeric rating and its accompanying text review is the 
most widely available form of user feedback. A measure which 
encapsulates the contents of such reviews is often necessary as they have 
been found to significantly influence the shopping behaviour of users. A 
fine-grained form of such measure that could act as perfect feedback about 
the product is a star rating. The review rating prediction tries to predict a 
rating corresponding to the given review.

### Problem Statement: 
Given the google rating data, use a hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster reviews.

### Aim & Objective: 
1. Analyzing the existing data and getting valuable insights about the review pattern 
2. Data pre-processing including missing value treatment 
3. Cluster the reviews based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’) with the help of dendrogram 

### Dataset Information: 
This data set is populated by capturing user ratings from Google reviews. 
Reviews on attractions from 24 categories across Europe are considered. 
Google user rating ranges from 1 to 5 and the average user rating per 
category is calculated.
